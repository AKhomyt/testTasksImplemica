    1. If we throw out the numbers and operation signs
    from a correctly written arithmetic expression containing
    numbers, operation signs and opening and closing
    parentheses, and then write the brackets remaining in
    the expression without spaces between them, then we will
    call the result the correct bracket expression
    [bracket expression " (()(()))" is correct, but "()(" and "())(" are not].
    Find the number of correct bracket expressions
    containing N opening and N closing brackets. N is entered
    from the keyboard. N is a non-negative integer.
    Example:
    N = 1 (one bracket each opening and closing) - answer 1
    ()
    )(
    ))
    ((
    Only one correct option
    For the entered number 2 - 2 :
    ()()
    (())
    That is, only two options, when all open brackets open / close correctly.
    And so on.

    2. You are given a list of cities. Each direct connection between
    two cities has its transportation cost (an integer bigger than 0).
    The goal is to find the paths of minimum cost between pairs of cities.
    Assume that the cost of each path (which is the sum of costs of
    all direct connections belonging to this path) is at most 200000.
    The name of a city is a string containing characters a,...,z and is
    at most 10 characters long.

<table id="resultT2"></table>

    3. Find the sum of the digits in the number 100! (i.e. 100 factorial)
    {Correct answer: 648}
    <label for="inputT3"></label><input id="inputT3" placeholder="..."/>
    <span id="resultT3"></span>
